DBLP Data Analysis Using Graph Characteristics
• By utilizing Python's Networkx and Pandas package, we created Undirected Author-Author Graph, Directed Paper-Citation Graph, and Undirected Venue-Author Graph to analyze the DBLP data. The Network characteristics were found for each of the three graphs.
• The top 5 authors with the most papers published were identified and analyzed the paper publishing pattern.
• The top 5 referred papers were found by using the in-degree centrality approach.
